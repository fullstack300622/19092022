Also tip: after you finish watching those videos I highly recommend you to not stop there.
You can start search for some tutorials on youtube there is a lot.
you can try search for things like:
javascript tutorial,
javascript map tutorial,
javascript array tutorial,
javascript callback functions,
etc etc..

Also don't be scared to go a little ahead!
Even if you will learn something that we won't learn in the class, this knowledge probably will be helpful in the future and also improve you as software developer.
